      body: "A full valet is our most thorough cleaning package. It combines a complete exterior decontamination wash with a deep interior clean, covering every surface of your vehicle. From snow foam pre-wash to final wax protection, from deep carpet extraction to dashboard detailing — nothing is overlooked. It takes 3 to 4 hours and leaves your car looking, feeling and smelling genuinely new. For Warrington vehicles that accumulate significant grime from the motorway network, a full valet is the proper reset.",

      body: "A full valet is ideal every 4–6 weeks as regular maintenance, or as a pre-sale preparation to maximise your vehicle's value. It's also the perfect seasonal reset — in spring after winter road salt accumulation, or in autumn before the next salt season. For Warrington commuters using the M6 and M62 regularly, a full valet 4–6 times a year keeps the vehicle genuinely clean, not just surface-washed.",

      question: 'How long does a full valet take in Warrington?',
      answer:
        "A full valet takes 3 to 4 hours depending on vehicle size and condition. Heavily soiled vehicles — particularly those used on Warrington's motorway network — may take slightly longer. We'll give you a realistic time estimate when we assess your car.",

      question: 'How much does a full valet cost in Warrington?',
      answer:
        'Full valets start from £90 for a standard car, increasing for larger vehicles (SUVs, vans). Contact us for an exact quote for your vehicle.',

    {
      question: 'Is a full valet different from car detailing?',
      answer:
        'Yes. A full valet is professional cleaning — it makes your car clean and fresh. Car detailing goes further with paint correction (removing scratches and swirl marks) and ceramic coating (long-term protection). A valet maintains your car; a detail restores it.',
