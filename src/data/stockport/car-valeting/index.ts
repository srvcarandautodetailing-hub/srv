  heroDescription:
    "Stockport's locally based mobile valeting specialist. We protect your paintwork from Greater Manchester's road salt, rain and urban grime — using safe hand-wash techniques and professional products. Covering all SK postcodes, 7 days a week.",
  introText:
    "Greater Manchester's wet winters and salt-treated roads are relentless on vehicle paintwork. SRV Detailing brings professional car valeting directly to your driveway across all Stockport SK postcodes — Bramhall, Cheadle, Marple, Hazel Grove, Heaton Moor and beyond. Every valet begins with a snow foam decontamination stage that safely lifts road salt, brake dust and bonded contamination before any contact with your clear coat — eliminating the swirl marks caused by automatic car washes. We use pH-neutral, paint-safe products and the two-bucket hand-wash method, finishing with a wax or sealant layer to protect your vehicle's finish between cleans.",

        "Car valeting is systematic, trained cleaning that protects your paint rather than simply making it look clean. Our process starts with decontamination: a snow foam pre-soak that encapsulates road salt, brake dust and organic matter before we touch the paint. We hand wash using the two-bucket method to prevent cross-contamination, treat the surface with a clay bar where bonded contamination is present, and apply a protective wax or sealant to the clear coat.",
        "Interior work covers thorough vacuuming, steam treatment of trim and vents, upholstery care and glass polish. Every product we use is pH-neutral and safe for factory paint, paint protection film (PPF) and ceramic-coated vehicles.",
