      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Mobile car valeting is a professional vehicle cleaning and presentation service delivered directly to your location — your home driveway, workplace car park, or any accessible spot across the Stockport area. Unlike a fixed detailing studio or a drive-through car wash, a mobile valet unit is entirely self-contained: SRV Detailing arrives with its own fresh water supply, power generator, professional-grade chemicals, and all equipment needed to complete the job. You provide nothing except access to your vehicle.',
        'The term valeting covers the full range of cleaning and presentation work on a motor vehicle — exterior washing, wheel and tyre cleaning, glass work, and a comprehensive interior clean covering upholstery, carpets, dashboard, door cards, and trim. A professional mobile valet is substantially more thorough than an automated car wash: we use pH-neutral shampoos formulated to protect existing wax and sealant layers, two-bucket hand wash techniques that dramatically reduce the risk of swirl marks, and purpose-built detailing brushes for intricate areas such as alloy wheel spokes, door shuts, and air vents.',
        'Mobile car valeting is distinct from car detailing. Professional detailing is a paint-focused discipline encompassing decontamination, machine polishing, paint correction, and the application of protective treatments such as ceramic coatings or paint protection film. Valeting is a deep cleaning and presentation service — the essential foundation on which detailing work is built. For the majority of drivers across Stockport and Greater Manchester, regular mobile valeting is the single most cost-effective way to protect a vehicle\'s condition, appearance, and long-term market value.',

      items: [
        'Pre-inspection — we assess paint condition, identify existing damage, bird dropping etching, heavy contamination, or staining that may require specific treatment, and confirm the scope with you before beginning work.',
        'Snow foam pre-wash — a thick layer of pH-balanced traffic film remover (TFR) is applied across the entire vehicle using a foam lance. The product dwells on the surface, chemically dissolving and suspending road grime, diesel soot, and organic contamination before any physical contact is made with the paintwork.',
        'Pressure rinse — the snow foam — along with the contaminants it has lifted — is fully rinsed from the vehicle, ensuring a clean surface before hand washing begins.',
        'Two-bucket hand wash — a clean microfibre wash mitt is loaded from the shampoo bucket and worked methodically panel by panel from the roof down. Spent shampoo solution is discharged into a separate rinse bucket fitted with a grit guard, preventing abrasive particles from re-entering the wash mitt and inflicting fine scratches on the clear coat.',
        'Wheel and tyre decontamination — an iron fallout remover spray is applied to alloy wheels. The product reacts with ferrous brake dust particles embedded in the wheel surface, turning purple-red on contact and chemically dissolving contamination before rinsing. Multiple detailing brushes address the barrel, spokes, caliper faces, and tyre sidewalls.',
        'Final rinse and microfibre drying — the vehicle is thoroughly rinsed and dried immediately using large, clean, plush microfibre drying towels. We do not use chamois leather, which can harbour abrasive grit and cause fine scratching across painted surfaces.',
        'Interior vacuum — all seats, carpets, boot liner, and door pockets are vacuumed to a high standard. Detailing crevice tools clear accumulated debris from between seat rails, gear lever surrounds, and dashboard air vents where a domestic vacuum cannot reach effectively.',
        'Dashboard and interior wipe-down — hard interior surfaces including the dashboard, door cards, centre console, and steering wheel are cleaned and treated with a rubber- and plastic-safe interior protectant. This product cleans, conditions, and provides UV protection against fading and brittleness.',
        'Glass clean — all interior glass surfaces are cleaned with a dedicated automotive glass cleaner and polished to a streak-free, optically clear finish. Exterior glass is cleaned as standard on a full valet.',
        'Finishing and quality check — tyres are dressed with a water-based tyre dressing for a clean satin finish. Faded plastic exterior trim is treated where included in the service. A final walk-around inspection ensures the vehicle meets the quality standard before we leave.',

        'Traffic film and diesel soot — vehicles commuting on the A6, M60, A555, or Stockport ring road accumulate a visible grey film of exhaust particulate and road grime within days of cleaning',
        'Bird dropping acid etching — bird droppings contain uric acid that begins attacking the clear coat within hours; in warm or sunny weather, permanent etch marks can form within a single day if not removed promptly',
        'Tar spot contamination — road bitumen, particularly from freshly surfaced roads, adheres to lower painted panels and cannot be removed safely by conventional washing alone',
        'Interior bacterial contamination — a car steering wheel can harbour significantly more bacteria than most public surfaces; professional interior cleaning with anti-bacterial products eliminates this hygiene risk',

      heading: 'Why Regular Valeting Matters in Stockport\'s Climate',
      bodyParagraphs: [
        'Stockport sits within one of the wettest regions in England. Greater Manchester records in excess of 800mm of annual rainfall — significantly above the UK national average of approximately 600mm. Persistent moisture creates conditions for water spotting on glass and paintwork, promotes mildew and mould growth inside vehicles, and keeps road contaminants in a mobile, chemically active state rather than drying and falling off harmlessly. Drivers across the SK postcode area face paint contamination challenges that are more severe and more frequent than those experienced in drier parts of the country.',
        'Winter road management across Stockport Borough involves sustained pre-gritting and reactive salting of all major routes through the SK1 to SK12 postcode network. This includes the A6 (Stockport to Manchester corridor through Heaton Chapel and Levenshulme), the A560 (Cheadle Hulme and Gatley), and residential roads throughout Bramhall, Hazel Grove, Reddish, Heaton Moor, and Marple. Sodium chloride road salt is highly effective at preventing ice formation, but it is equally effective at attacking exposed metal, brake components, alloy wheel lacquer, and painted body panels. A professional valet that removes accumulated salt deposits before they compound across successive winter weeks is a straightforward and measurable preventative investment.',
        'The M60 motorway forms the southern arc of Greater Manchester\'s ring road, with Stockport at the junction of the M60 and M56. Vehicles commuting through this corridor accumulate traffic film, iron fallout from railway level crossings, and diesel and petrol particulate matter at an accelerated rate compared to rural or lower-traffic driving routes. Iron contamination — invisible to the naked eye but easily detected with a chemical fallout test — is particularly prevalent in Stockport\'s urban and commuter belt areas and causes gradual oxidative damage to clear coat and wheel lacquer surfaces without ever appearing visibly dirty. A professional mobile valet with iron decontamination is not simply about making a vehicle look clean — it is about arresting active chemical damage.',

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How much does mobile car valeting cost in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Mobile car valeting in Stockport starts from £45 for a maintenance valet (exterior wash, wheel clean, tyre dressing, and interior vacuum) and from £90 for a full valet covering comprehensive exterior and interior treatment. Pricing varies by vehicle size — a large SUV, MPV, or van requires more time and product than a small hatchback. Contact SRV Detailing for a personalised quote based on your vehicle type and current condition.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does a mobile car valet take in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'A maintenance valet typically takes between 1 and 1.5 hours. A full valet — covering all exterior and interior surfaces to a professional standard — generally takes between 2.5 and 4 hours, depending on vehicle size and how heavily soiled it is. We always give an honest time estimate before starting and communicate clearly if additional time is needed.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you need water or electricity at my address?',
      answer:
        'No. Our mobile unit carries its own fresh water tank and an onboard power generator. We require nothing from you except access to your vehicle and a parking space to work alongside it. This makes us genuinely suitable for flats, workplaces, communal parking areas, and any location that lacks outdoor water access.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between a maintenance valet and a full valet?',
      answer:
        'A maintenance valet covers the exterior hand wash, wheel clean, tyre dressing, interior vacuum, and a quick wipe of dashboard surfaces. A full valet is substantially more comprehensive: it includes a thorough interior deep clean of all surfaces, seats, carpets, boot, door cards, steering wheel, console, and glass — alongside all exterior processes including snow foam pre-wash, hand wash, wheel decontamination, and trim dressing. Add-on services such as clay bar decontamination, leather conditioning, odour removal, and upholstery cleaning are available on request.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you valet my car in cold or wet weather in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'Light and moderate rain does not stop us — and given Greater Manchester\'s climate, we account for wet conditions in how we plan and carry out work. In heavy or sustained rainfall we may need to reschedule exterior paintwork stages to protect the quality of the finish. Interior valeting can always proceed regardless of weather conditions. We communicate proactively about any weather-related adjustments and aim to complete or reschedule with minimum disruption to you.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will mobile valeting remove swirl marks from my paintwork?',
      answer:
        'No. Swirl marks are micro-scratches embedded in the clear coat layer that require machine polishing — a form of paint correction — to remove. A standard valet is a cleaning and presentation service that will make your vehicle look significantly better, but it does not address sub-surface paint defects. If you have visible swirl marks, water spotting etched into the paint, or deeper scratches, our paint correction service or a machine polish add-on is the appropriate treatment to discuss.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I get my car valeted in Stockport?',
      answer:
        'For most Stockport drivers, a full valet every 2 to 3 months combined with a maintenance valet or maintenance wash every 4 to 6 weeks provides a good protection and presentation schedule. Vehicles used daily on heavy-traffic roads such as the A6 or M60, those transporting pets or children, and vehicles parked outdoors without a garage will benefit from more frequent professional cleaning. The Greater Manchester climate — with its above-average rainfall and winter road salting — makes regular removal of salt, iron, and organic contamination more important than in drier parts of the UK.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you cover Cheadle Hulme, Bramhall, Hazel Grove, and other Stockport areas?',
      answer:
        'Yes. We cover the full SK postcode area including Cheadle Hulme (SK8), Bramhall (SK7), Hazel Grove (SK7), Heaton Moor (SK4), Heaton Norris (SK4), Reddish (SK5), Marple (SK6), Edgeley (SK3), and Stockport town centre (SK1). We are based in Dukinfield, making us genuinely local to the entire Stockport Borough. Visit our Stockport areas page for full coverage and postcode details.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What does a full interior valet include?',
      answer:
        'A full interior valet covers: thorough vacuuming of all seats, carpets, boot liner, door pockets, and the area beneath seats and seat rails; crevice cleaning of all vents, gear surrounds, and console recesses; cleaning and conditioning of dashboard, centre console, door cards, and all plastic and vinyl surfaces; steering wheel and gear lever sanitation; streak-free cleaning of all interior windows and mirrors; and anti-bacterial treatment of high-contact surfaces where required. Leather conditioning and fabric upholstery deep cleaning are available as add-on services.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is mobile valeting as effective as using a fixed detailing studio?',
      answer:
        'For cleaning and presentation services — valeting — mobile work is as effective as studio work, and often more so because your vehicle receives the undivided attention of the operator rather than being processed alongside multiple other cars. For advanced paint correction, ceramic coating application, or paint protection film installation, a controlled studio environment with consistent lighting, temperature regulation, and specialist equipment has practical advantages. SRV Detailing offers both: mobile valeting for convenient regular maintenance and studio-based detailing for paint protection treatments.',
