  faqs: [
    { question: 'Do you charge extra for larger vehicles?', answer: 'Yes, vehicle size affects pricing. SUVs and 4x4s typically cost 20–30% more than standard saloons due to the additional surface area and time required.' },
    { question: 'Is there a call-out fee for Manchester?', answer: 'No. We do not charge call-out fees for any address within Greater Manchester. The quoted price includes travel.' },
    { question: 'Do you offer package deals?', answer: 'Yes. Combining services (e.g. paint correction + ceramic coating) is cheaper than booking them separately. We also offer maintenance plans for regular customers.' },
