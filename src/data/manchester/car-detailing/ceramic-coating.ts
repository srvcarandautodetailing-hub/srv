      heading: 'What Is Ceramic Coating?',
      body: 'Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that chemically bonds with your vehicle\'s paintwork to create a semi-permanent protective layer. Unlike traditional waxes that last weeks, or sealants that last months, a professionally applied ceramic coating lasts 2 to 7+ years. It creates a hydrophobic surface that repels water, dirt and contaminants while providing a deep, glossy finish.',

    {
      question: 'How long does ceramic coating last?',
      answer: 'Depending on the package chosen, ceramic coatings last between 3 and 7+ years. Durability depends on the product tier, maintenance routine, and environmental exposure. We provide full aftercare guidance to maximise longevity.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is paint correction necessary before ceramic coating?',
      answer: 'Yes. Ceramic coating locks in whatever is underneath — including swirl marks and scratches. We always correct the paint first so the coating seals a flawless finish. This is included in all our ceramic coating packages.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can you apply ceramic coating at my home?',
      answer: 'Yes. Our mobile unit is equipped with professional lighting, IR curing lamps, and a controlled environment setup. We can apply ceramic coatings on your driveway or in a covered space anywhere across Manchester.',

    {
      question: 'Do you need to maintain a ceramic coating?',
