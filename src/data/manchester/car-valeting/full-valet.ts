      body: 'A full valet is ideal as a regular maintenance service every 4–6 weeks, a pre-sale preparation to maximise your vehicle\'s value, or a seasonal deep clean after winter or summer. It\'s also the perfect reset before or after a long road trip, or simply when your car needs more than a quick wash.',

      question: 'How long does a full valet take?',
      answer: 'A full valet takes 3 to 4 hours depending on vehicle size and condition. Heavily soiled vehicles may take slightly longer. We\'ll give you a time estimate when we assess your car.',

      question: 'How much does a full valet cost in Manchester?',
      answer: 'Full valets start from £90 for a standard car. Prices increase for larger vehicles (SUVs, vans). Contact us for an exact quote for your vehicle.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is a full valet different from car detailing?',
      answer: 'Yes. A full valet is professional cleaning — it makes your car clean and fresh. Car detailing goes further with paint correction (removing scratches) and ceramic coating (long-term protection). A valet maintains; a detail restores.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How often should I get a full valet?',
      answer: 'Every 4–6 weeks for most vehicles. If you have a ceramic coating, every 6–8 weeks with a maintenance wash between visits. Monthly maintenance valets between full valets keep things fresh.',
