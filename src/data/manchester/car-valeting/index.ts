      question: 'How often should I get my car valeted?',
      answer: 'For most vehicles, a full valet every 4–6 weeks keeps your car in excellent condition. Between full valets, a monthly maintenance valet maintains the finish. If your car is ceramic coated, quarterly valeting with a maintenance wash is sufficient.',

      answer: 'A full valet (3–4 hours) includes complete interior deep clean, exterior decontamination wash, clay bar, wax protection and wheel detailing. A maintenance valet (60–90 minutes) is a maintenance service covering exterior wash, interior vacuum, dashboard wipe and glass cleaning.',
