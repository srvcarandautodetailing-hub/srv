      bodyParagraphs: [
        "Car detailing prices reflect the time, products, and expertise required for each specific vehicle. Larger vehicles — Range Rover, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne — take longer than compact cars across every service stage. Vehicles with heavily defected paint require more correction stages and more time under panel lighting than vehicles with light swirling only. The condition of the interior, the type of leather, and the degree of soiling all affect the time required for interior work.",
        "We never provide flat-rate prices that incentivise rushing work. Our pricing is transparent based on an honest assessment of your vehicle. We provide exact quotes before any work begins and do not add charges without discussion.",

      question: 'Why does car detailing cost more than a regular car wash?',
      answer:
        "Professional detailing uses significantly more time, specialist equipment, and professional-grade products than any car wash service. A ceramic coating application on a prestige vehicle involves 6–10 hours of work, paint depth measurement, machine polishing, panel inspection lighting, and careful coating application — none of which is involved in a drive-through wash. The price reflects genuine specialist labour and materials.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Do you charge more for prestige vehicles in Wilmslow?',
      answer:
        "Prestige vehicles typically take longer due to their size, complexity of panel shapes, and the additional care required with specialist paint finishes, Alcantara, and premium leather. This is reflected in pricing honestly rather than charging a 'premium' surcharge for the badge. We price based on the actual work required.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get a quote before booking?',
      answer:
        "Yes — always. Call us on 07375 759686 or use our contact form with your vehicle details and the service you're interested in. We provide an accurate quote based on your vehicle and requirements before any commitment.",
