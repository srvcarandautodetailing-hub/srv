  introText:
    "Wilmslow's roads carry some of the most prestigious vehicles in the North West — Porsche Cayennes and Taycans running along the A34 through Alderley Edge, Range Rover Autobiographies on the lanes around Lindow Common, and AMG estates on the school-run through Styal. These vehicles deserve professional care from a technician who understands paint systems, not an automated brush wash. SRV Detailing is a fully mobile, self-contained car care specialist covering all SK9 postcodes — Wilmslow town, Dean Row, Styal, Lacey Green, and Prestbury Road. We bring machine polishers, ceramic coating products, steam cleaners, and hot water extraction systems directly to your home or workplace. No queues, no brushes, no swirl marks.",

        "Wilmslow presents distinct care requirements compared to urban areas. The A34 through Alderley Edge is the principal source of winter road salt, depositing sodium chloride across lower panels and wheel arches from October through March. The Cheshire countryside lanes around Styal and Lindow Common carry agricultural run-off and organic debris in autumn. Aircraft operations from Manchester Airport — just 3 miles north — introduce de-icing chemical residues during winter and spring that settle on vehicles parked in northern Wilmslow and Styal. These are all factors our professional decontamination process addresses systematically.",
