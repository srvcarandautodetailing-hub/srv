      bodyParagraphs: [
        "Vehicle size is the primary price factor — a Range Rover Autobiography or Bentley Bentayga requires significantly more time than a compact hatchback across every stage of a valet. Vehicle condition is the second factor — a heavily soiled interior or months of accumulated road salt and contamination require more time and product than a vehicle in regular care.",
        "We price honestly based on an accurate assessment of your vehicle rather than incentivising rushed work with artificially low flat rates. Every Wilmslow customer receives a confirmed price before any work begins.",

      question: 'Do you charge a call-out fee for Wilmslow?',
      answer:
        'No. There is no call-out fee for any SK9 address or the immediately adjacent areas including Alderley Edge and Handforth. A small travel charge may apply for more distant locations such as Knutsford or Macclesfield — always confirmed at booking.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Why is a professional valet more expensive than a car wash?',
      answer:
        "A professional mobile valet involves significantly more time, specialist equipment, and professional-grade products than any automated or manual car wash. A full valet takes 3–4 hours of careful, skilled work — proper decontamination, safe hand washing, thorough interior treatment, and protective finishing. The price reflects genuine professional labour.",

      question: 'Can I get a quote for my specific vehicle?',

        "Yes. Call us on 07375 759686 or use our contact form with your vehicle make, model, and the service you need. We provide an accurate, no-obligation quote before any booking is confirmed.",
